# CP-31 Daily Problem Solving

Daily solutions to problems from the **CP-31 Sheet** by **TLE Eliminators**.  
Objective: Maintain consistent competitive programming practice.

## Rules
- One problem per day.
- Write clean, optimized, and correct code.
- No skipping days without a valid reason.

---

## Workflow
1. Select the next problem from the CP-31 Sheet.
2. Implement the solution in C++.
3. Test against sample and edge cases.
4. Commit and push to GitHub.
Each folder contains the solution for that day.
